# Introduction to various tools

To work with repo fork it privately and then complete all the exercises. To fork a github repository go into [tutorial website](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). While forking a repository remember to make it private and share it with [Leader](https://github.com/SzymKwiatkowski).

## Important tips
A couple of tips for exercises:
- Use internet please
- If something does not work think process trough again
- Do not give up and just work on the solution because that is the only way you will learn

# Order of making exercises
There is no saying which might be easiest but by my own opinion it will be:
1. Cpp - compile
2. Python
3. stm32
4. docker
5. KiCad
6. Cpp - Cmake
